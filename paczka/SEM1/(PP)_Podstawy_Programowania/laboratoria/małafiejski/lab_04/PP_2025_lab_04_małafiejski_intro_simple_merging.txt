PCPMRGV1 - Simple merging

You goal is to merge two sorted sequences of integers of length at most 100 into one sorted sequence and print it to the output.
Input

In the first line there are two integers n1 and n2, i.e., the sizes of two sequences, respectively. Then, in the two following lines you are provided two sorted sequences of integers, one sequence per line.
Output

Merged sorted sequence consisting of all elements from both sequences, preserving the order.
Example 1

Input:
2 3
3 5
1 2 6
Output:
1 2 3 5 6

Example 2

Input:
5 4
0 1 6 6 7
1 2 3 10
Output:
0 1 1 2 3 6 6 7 10
