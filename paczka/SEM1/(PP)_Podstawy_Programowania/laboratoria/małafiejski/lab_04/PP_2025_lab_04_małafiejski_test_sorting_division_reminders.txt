ITPSRNUM - Sorting division remainders

You are given in the input a sequence of integer positive numbers. Write to the output the sequence of division remainders of these numbers over a small integer but sorted in the non-decreasing order.
Input

In the first line, you are given two numbers n and k, where 1<=n<=1000 and 1<=k<=10. and in the following one line you are given n integers of value between 0 and 1000000.
Output

Write to the output in one line the sequence of division remainders of the input n integer numbers over a number k but sorted in the non-decreasing order.
