PCPRSUBS - Reverse the subsequence

You are given N integers in the input. Moreover, you are given two bounds, the upper bound U and the lower bound L, where L<=U. You have to find all the elements of values between L and U from the original sequence and to reverse its order in the original sequence.

Let us follow the example of the initial sequence of 10 integers, and let us assume that the lower and the upper bound is 7 and 20, respectively. The subsequence of integers of values from 7 to 20 is bold.

5 18 2 7 10 2 20 20 0 9 

The subsequence is as follows:

18 7 10 20 20 9

Now, reverse its order:

9 20 20 10 7 18

and put the reversed subsequence into the original input sequence:

5 9 2 20 20 2 10 7 0 18

Input

In the first line, you are given three numbers N, L and U, where 1<=N<=100, and U and U are lower and upper bound, respectively, with L <= U. In the following one line your are given N integers of value between -1000 and 1000.
Output

The sequence consisting of all the integers from the input but with the reversed subsequence of all integers of values from L to U.
Example 1

Input:
5 -2 3
-2 4 3 -1 4

Output:
-1 4 3 -2 4
