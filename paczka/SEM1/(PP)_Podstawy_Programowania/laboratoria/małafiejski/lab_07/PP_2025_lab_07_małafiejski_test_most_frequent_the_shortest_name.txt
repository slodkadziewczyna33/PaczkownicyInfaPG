OOPS - Most frequent the shortest name

Find the average age of all persons with the most frequent name among the shortest names. If there are a few names that are the most frequent (i.e., with the same number of occurences) from the shortest ones, calculate separately the average age of all persons with a given name, and write the results in separate lines.
Input

There are given at most 1000 records, where each record is written in a separate line ending with newline character (even after the last line). Each record consists of a name (of length at most 25 characters) and age (the integer between 0 and 150), separated by whitespace and ending with a newline character.
Output

In each line write the name and the average age (represented as a floating point number with the precision limited to two decimal points) for each most frequent name among the shortest names. If there are two or more most frequent names among the shortest names, write these names in the lexicographical order, e.g., Dalton before Joseph, as in the example below.
Example 1

Input:
Gilbert 35
Anna 35
Anna 15
Gilbert 20
Joseph 40

Output:
Anna 25.00

Example 2

Input:
Annamarie 20
Joseph 40
Joseph 50
Annamarie 30
Dalton 30
Dalton 20
Annamarie 40
Output:
Dalton 25.00
Joseph 45.00

Remark

There are 6 test cases. First three of them, you may see in case of wrong answer, and the rest three test cases are hidden. Points for test cases: 0,0,0,1,1,1. Altogether you may get 3 points for this problem.
