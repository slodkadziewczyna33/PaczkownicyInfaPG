OOPRNIDO - Remove non-identifiers

Write the program that removes all the non-identifiers from a given line but only in non-commented part of the line. Identifier is a sequence of characters from set 'a'-'z' or 'A'-'Z' or '0'-'9' or '_', starting from any letter or underline character ('_'). The comment in a line is C++ style, i.e., it starts with // (twice '/') and ends with the new line character ('\n'). Assume that each lines ends with the new line character.
Input

There are given some number of data sets. Each data set is a line consisting from the sequence of some number of words, separated by spaces. A word is a sequence of any ASCII characters of code from 33 till 126, e.g., aqui28$-3q or _dat_. The second word is an identifier, but the first one not.
Output

Rewrite the line but with removed non-identifiers which appeared in the non-commented part of each line.
Example

Input:
Dato25 has 2 c-ats // and 3 _dogs.
op8ax _yu! _yu-67 great//-job ax~no identifier

Output:
Dato25 has // and 3 _dogs.
op8ax great//-job ax~no identifier

Remark

There are 6 test cases worth 0,0,1,1,1,1 points, respectively. Three first test cases are unhidden. Please note that three last test cases are judged by the judge which is ignoring missing or additional white spaces.
