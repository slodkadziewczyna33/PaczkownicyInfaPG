PCPBSUBS - Sums of two subsequences with bounds

You are given N integers in the input (negative, positive or 0's). Moreover, you are given two bounds, the upper bound U and the lower bound L. Please compute the sum of all positive integers lower than U and the sum of all negative integers greater than L.
Input

In the first line, you are given three numbers N, U and L, where 1<=N<=100, and U and L are upper and lower bound, respectively, with U >= L. In the following one line your are given N integers of value between -1000 and 1000.
Output

Two integers, with whitespace between them. The first integer is the sum of all positive integers from the input which are lower than U and the second integer is the sum of all negative integers from the input which are greater than L.
Example 1

Input:
5 4 -2
-2 2 3 -1 4

Output:
5 -1

Example 2

Input:
6 5 -5
0 3 4 -2 6 -10

Output:
7 -2

Example 3

Input:
2 0 -1
1 -1

Output:
0 0
