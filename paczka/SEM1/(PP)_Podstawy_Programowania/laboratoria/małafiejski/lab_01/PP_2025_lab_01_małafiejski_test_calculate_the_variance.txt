PCPCAVAR - Calculate the variance

Write a program calculating the variance value of the sequence of integers. For a given sequence of n numbers x1,...,xn, variance Var=( (x1-Avg)^2+...+(xn-Avg)^2)/n, where Avg is the average value of the sequence, i.e., Avg=(x1+...+xn)/n.
Input

In the first line, you are given one number n, where 1<=n<=1000, and in the following one line you are given n integers of value between -1000 and 1000.
Output

The variance of the input sequence of integers represented as a floating point number with the precision limited to two decimal points.
Example

Input:
5
2 2 3 5 7

Output:
3.76

Remark

There are 5 test cases. First two of them, you may see in case of wrong answer, and the rest three test cases are hidden. Points for test cases: 0,0,0.5,0.5,1. Altogether you may get 2 points for this problem.
