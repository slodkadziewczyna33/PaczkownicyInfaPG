ITPCPTS - Closest Pair of Points

Write the program that finds the square of minimum Euclidean distance between two points among n points on the plane. See Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance.
Input

In the first line there is a number 2 <= n <= 30000. In each of n next lines there are two integers from [-1000000,1000000] denoting coordinates of a point.
Output

Print a square of the distance between closest two points.
Examples

Input:
5
1 1
2 2
3 3
0 2
2 0
Output:
2

Note
There are given three test cases. Two first test cases are worth 1 point each and the third test case is worth 3 points.
