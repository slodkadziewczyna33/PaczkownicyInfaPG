OOPRSLET - Extract and reverse

You are given N words in the input, each word in the separate line. Words are sequences of small and capital letters. You have to convert all words, line by line, as follows: extract the subsequence of small letters from the original word, reverse it and put the reversed word into the original word, preserving the positions of letters.

Let us follow the example word: aLObagTARx. The subsequence with small letters is: abagx, and reversed is xgaba. Now put it in the original word: xLOgabTARa.
Input
